This game was developed using OpenGL,freeglut,DevIL,SFML and irrKLang libraries. The rule of the game is simple, the target score is 250 and in order to score, the player has two options, i.e., clicking on red (10 points) and yellow (20 points) circles. However, if the player misclicks, then the score is differenced by 10 points. A timer is set for a minute and half. As this is an amateur attempt, the beta version still features few bugs, which will be updated in the further versions.
